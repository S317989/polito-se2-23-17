TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- 6 stories committed | 2 stories done
- 29 points committed | 8 points done
- 48 h | hours spent by team (9 per me)

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics (login missing??)

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   | Create the Db     |       |  4h          |  2h            |
| _#0_   | Authorization and authentication     |       |  3h          |  ?            |
| _#0_   | Configure the backend side     |       |  4h          |  ?           |
| n 1     | Select service and print ticket(frontend)         |  3      | 2h           |              |
| n 1     | Select service and print ticket(backend)         |  3      | 2h           |              |

| n 4     | See stats (backend)         |  3      | 2h           |              |

   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
- We underestimated the time dedicated to testing and setting the project at the beginning.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
- The importance of having periodically updates with the rest of the team, to keep working in sync.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

  > Propose one or two
  - Keep updating the rest of the team periodically and have more meetings, to coordinate better. 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
- 

Cose da miglirare: definire da subito i dettagli della tecnologia, progettare insieme db e struttura progetto
-definire insieme testing processo
-definire un ordine di lavoro sulle stories by importance
